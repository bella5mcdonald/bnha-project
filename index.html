  <p style="font-family:marvel;font-size:28px;text-align:center">hello! i just learned how to use html, css, and javascript,, so i figured that using my new skill to make this would be a great use of my time this summer!
      here is my attempt at a website on the hit anime 'my hero academia' ! i'll discuss my opinions on the show and characters.. hopefully i will put together a discussion board where we can all discuss together (*•̀ᴗ•́*)و ̑̑<br>
  should i start with an overview of what the show is ? there probably isn't a better way to start so here goes nothing..:</p>

 <h1 style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:50px"> <strong>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟMY HERO ACADEMIA✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ</strong></h1>
  <p style="font-family:marvel;font-size:30px">in a world where 80% of the population has a 'quirk', having some sort of special power/ability becomes very normal. quirks can range in power and specialty– one may have a 
    useless or useful ability, quirks are typically hereditary. some people may end up quirkless. society still functions pretty much the same, except a new career is born: <b><i>THE HERO</i></b> (i guess two new careers are born
    if you count the villain). <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/159c6958-eb21-43fd-ad9a-c3e063a61973%2F9cc9f560eacfc75acfe8653a59c4e08d.jpg?1540226136163" align="right" id="homeimg">in my hero academia, viewers follow the story of a
    boy named izuku midoriya who dreams of becoming a hero one day, but also happens to be quirkless. throughout the story izuku makes contact with the number one hero, who is also izuku's role model, all might. all might passes his quirk onto izuku via izuku ingesting his hair [ some fine cuisine if you ask me (-﹏-) ].
   this way, izuku is admitted to train to become a hero at an esteemed hero school <b><i>'UA high'</i></b> where he meets others his age who are also hoping to one day become heroes. from here, the journey begins– izuku, his classmates, pro heroes, villains, 
    and other hero schools are in for a wild ride.</p>
